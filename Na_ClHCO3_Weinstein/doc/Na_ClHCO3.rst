Na_ClHCO3  Complex Transporter
----------

Na_ClHCO3 is a Complex Transporter with 1:-1:2 stoichiometry, located on Peritubular Membrane which
includes both Cell-Lateral Membrane (ie) /Cell-Basal (is) Membrane. The coupled tranport net coeeficient may vary according into their locations.
These fluxes are defined base on the electrochemical potential of species [Joule/ml].
