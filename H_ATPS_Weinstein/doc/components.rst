Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the H-ATPs go to <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see the formulation of H-ATPs go to  <../components/H_ATPS.cellml>
- To see parameters specified for H-ATPs pump in Weinstein 1992  go to <../components/Weinstein_H_ATPS_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_H_ATPS.cellml
