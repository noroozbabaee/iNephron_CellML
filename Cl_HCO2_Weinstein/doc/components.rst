Cl_HCO2 trasporter Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the Cl/HCO2  simple exchanger, the following component is used <../components/Generator.cellml>
- Cl/HCO2 exchanger go to  <../components/Cl_HCO2.cellml>
- To see the parameters specified for Cl_HCO2 trasporter in Weinstein 1992 go to <../components/Weinstein_Cl_HCO2_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_Cl_HCO2.cellml
