NaK Pump
----------
Na-K pump powered by ATP, the pump moves sodium and potassium  ions in opposite
directions, each against its concentration
gradient.In  a single cycle of the pump, three cytosolic sodium ions are
extruded from and two  potassium ions or NH4 ions (cations)  are imported into the cell. Na_K ATPS pumps are located on Peritubular Membrane which
includes both Cell-Lateral Membrane (ie) /Cell-Basal (is) Membrane.
