Na_NH4 transporter Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the Na_NH4 transporter component <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To check the Na_NH4 transporter formulation, see  <../components/Na_NH4.cellml>
- Parameters specified for SGLT trasporter in Weinstein 1992, see <../components/Weinstein_Na_NH4_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_Na_NH4.cellml>


Na_NH4 transporter CellML model can be  reused in future studies and models.
