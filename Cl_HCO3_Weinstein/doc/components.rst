Cl/HCO3 exchanger Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the Cl/HCO3  simple exchanger, the following component is used <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see the Cl/HCO3 formulation, see <../components/Cl_HCO3.cellml>
- To check the parameters specified for Cl_HCO3 trasporter in Weinstein 1992, see <../components/Weinstein_Cl_HCO3_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_Cl_HCO3.cellml
