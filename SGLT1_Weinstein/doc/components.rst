SGLT1 Transporter Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the SGLT transporter component <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see Na_Glucose (SGLT1) transporter formulation check <../components/SGLT1.cellml>
- For parameters specified for SGLT1 trasporter in Weinstein 1992, see <../components/Weinstein_SGLT1.cellml>
- To run the experiment check <../experiment/experiment_SGLT1.cellml>
