Components:NaK Pump
-------------------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the SGLT transporter component <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see the formulation for KCl transporter, go to <../components/NaK.cellml>
- Parameters specified for NaK pump in Weinstein 1992  <../components/Weinstein_NaK_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment, go to <experiment_NaK.cellml>.

Nak CellML model can be  reused in future studies and models.
