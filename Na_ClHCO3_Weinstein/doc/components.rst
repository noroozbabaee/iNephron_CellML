Na_ClHCO3  complex transporter components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the Na_ClHCO3  complex transporter see <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see Na_ClHCO3 transporter formulation go to <../components/Na_ClHCO3.cellml>
- To find parameters specified for Na_ClHCO3 trasporter in Weinstein 1992 check <../components/Weinstein_Na_ClHCO3_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_Na_ClHCO3.cellml>

Na_ClHCO3 CellML model can be  reused in future studies and models.
