KCl simple cotransporter
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which is considered as an input for the KCl transportergo to <../general/Generator.cellml>
- To see KCl transporter formulation go to <../components/KCl.cellml>
- To check the parameters specified for KCl trasporter in Weinstein 1992  go to <../components/Weinstein_KCl_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_KCl.cellml>
