Components
----------

CellML divides the mathematical model into distinct components, which are able to be re-used.
The main CellML components are:

- To generate the required variables which will be considered as an input for the Na/H  simple exchanger, the following component is used: <../components/Generator.cellml>
- To see Na/H exchanger formulation <../components/Na_H.cellml>
- To see the parameters specified for Na_H trasporter in Weinstein 1992, see component <../components/Weinstein_Na_H_92.cellml>
- To run the experiment go to <../experiment/experiment_Na_H.cellml>


Na_H CellML model can be  reused in future studies and models.
